## Requirements Coverage

### Objective
- **Robust test automation framework** – Built using `pytest` with unit, integration, and system tests (`tests/`).  
- Runs automatically in **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push/PR.  
- Includes reporting and history tracking through `make_report.py`.  

---

### Functional Requirements
1. **Automated unit tests** – `tests/test_disaster_unit.py` checks individual functions in `disaster_app.py`.  
2. **Automated integration tests** – `tests/test_disaster_integration.py` verifies that different parts of the app work together.  
3. **System tests** – `tests/test_disaster_system.py` simulates full workflows with multiple reports and responders.  
4. **Test case management** – JSON case files in `tests/cases/` with a CLI runner (`runner.py`) to list or run cases by type or ID.  
5. **CI/CD integration** – Defined in `ci.yml`, tests are triggered automatically with coverage reports on each push/PR.  
6. **Detailed reporting with trends** – `make_report.py` combines results (`results.xml`, `coverage.xml`), writes a `final_report.json`, appends to `reports/history.json`, logs to `reports/report.log`, and prints a summary of recent runs.  

---

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Logging & error handling** – Logging is built into `disaster_app.py` functions and `make_report.py` wraps parsing with try/except and writes errors to `reports/report.log`.  
2. **Execution under 5 minutes** – The test suite is small and completes in seconds, meeting the requirement for fast feedback.  
3. **Scalability** – New cases can be added easily by dropping JSON files into `tests/cases/` and running them with the CLI.  
4. **Security best practices** – `.gitignore` excludes reports, results, and logs from version control so they only exist as CI artifacts, not in the repo.  
5. **Usability & onboarding** – `runner.py` provides simple commands for listing and running cases. The updated `README.md` explains setup, runner usage, reporting, and CI workflow clearly.

**Conclusion:** The framework meets the project objective (3.1), all functional requirements (3.2), and all non-functional requirements (3.3). It provides automated testing, CI integration, reporting with history, and an easy way for developers to add and manage cases.
